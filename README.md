# JJson, a Java JSON library

Don't use this. It doesn't support full JSON. Just the amount I needed to parse some basic requests. Maybe I'll add more stuff to it later.

Usage:
- Create a class to hold the object. Keys must exactly match between the JSON and the object. See JsonExample.java
- Call the JsonParser constructor with the JSON string and your object. See Json.java
